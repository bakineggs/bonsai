Tests For:
  Parsing:
    Rule:
      make sure conditions != NULL

    Condition:
      make sure creates_node = true and matches_node = true can't happen
      make sure removes_node = true and matches_node = false can't happen
      make sure creates_node = true and removes_node = true can't happen
      make sure creates_node = true and exact = true can't happen
      make sure variable != NULL and children != NULL can't happen

    Node:
      make sure only one of children, integer_value, float_value, or string_value can be != NULL

  Evaluation:
    make sure ordered conditions can't run on unordered nodes

Implement:
  parse ordered, exact, and multiple statements in rules
  parse user-defined code assignment to value
  parse program start state

numeric & string values in rules?
